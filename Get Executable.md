# How to get .exe
If you want to get .exe (executable),
You can go to
##### {source-code}/Geolocator/bin/Debug/Geolocator.exe

ðŸš§ WARNING ðŸš§
This executable works only in one place, if you want to have it somewhere
else, you need to make shortcut to it. Otherwise you need to export it to Executable
yourself! I don't know how to do this yet so find a tutorial please! :)
